# Wearable Real-time Fall Detection System
> <br> I collaborated with a team member to develop this wearable system that can detect real-time fall and send the data to Microsoft Azure for further analysis and visualization, and send messages to emergency contacts. 
>> <br> We implemented the hardware together, and I read many research papers and adopted a feasible fall detection algorithm, which mainly use acceleration magnitude, angle change and the personâ€™s reaction time to determine a fall state. The algorithm was implemented in fall_detection_final.ino in C on Arduino.
